SoundCloud is an awesome web service I often use.  However, it provides only website in OS X.  I don't want to find a browser in my desktop and then find the SoundCloud tab in my browser only for skipping, stopping and playing the music.  So I created this app.
You can access to the browser at any time via your Desktop menubar.

SoundKloud is integrated with menu.  So you can access the SoundCloud browser as if item of the menu.  Just click it!

At first time, you need to sign in to the page.  Please click "Sign in" in the page.  After that, you need not to login anymore.

If you want to quit this app, please use key shortcut `Control+Q` (`Command+Q` for OS X).
